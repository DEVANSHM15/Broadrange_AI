We are developing an agentic AI-based career path recommendation system that provides personalized guidance to students throughout their academic journey. The system leverages intelligent agents and data-driven insights to deliver tailored career recommendations, improving accuracy and user experience. Designed specifically for RVU degree programs, the platform acts as a comprehensive guide from the start to the end of a student’s academic life—offering detailed information on courses, semester-wise subjects, professors, resources, and relevant career opportunities.
